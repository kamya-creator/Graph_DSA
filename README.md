# ðŸ“Š Graph DSA

Welcome to the **Graph_DSA** repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of graph-related data structures and algorithms implemented in **Java**, with a strong focus on **interview preparation** and **competitive programming**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Clean Java implementations of popular graph algorithms
- ðŸ“š Ideal for practicing **DSA**, especially graphs
- ðŸ§  Includes classical problems like:
  - BFS / DFS
  - Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
  - Kruskalâ€™s & Primâ€™s MST
  - Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
  - Topological Sort
  - Flood Fill, Island Counting
  - Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
  - and many more...
